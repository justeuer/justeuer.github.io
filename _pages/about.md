I am an NLP researcher and linguist who attempts to reconcile two souls which, alas, are residing in my breast. I am interested in **information-theoretic** and **quantitative** approaches to typology, phonology and psycholinguistics, which has been the focus of my PhD at Saarland University. On the technical side this has involved pre-training language models on (very) small, developmentally plausible, and parallel corpora. 

In my postdoc I want to use **(mechanistic) interpretability** methods to identify shared structure in multilingual langauge models, ideally relating these structures to linguistic theory.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
